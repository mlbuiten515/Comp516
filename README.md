## Introduction ##

The objective of this project is to develop a model capable of classifying an asteroid's taxonomy and family based on spectral and orbital data.

To classify asteroids, we developed both an MLP and Extra Trees model. Since the MLP performed best on spectral data and Extra Trees performed best on family data.
